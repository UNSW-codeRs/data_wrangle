Date: 20th of June
Time: 2:30pm - 3:30pm
Location: BioSciG07 CATS room in Building D26, Ground floor
Presenters: Dr. Isaac Towers

Come and learn how to transform and manipulate your data into useful formats for analysis or plotting! Please have R and RStudio installed on your computer prior to the workshop. Basic knowledge such as reading in data into R, knowledge of project directories is assumed but not necessary

Presenter bio: 

How do hyper-diverse communities of plants emerge and seemingly persist without driving each other to extinction? This is the question that motivates my recent research, from my PhD at the University of Queensland where I studied tiny annual wildflowers in the Western Australian wheatbelt, to my postdoc at UNSW where I am investigating how colossal eucalypts communities will respond to climate change. Data wrangling, computer programming and statistical analysis have been critical tools in addressing my research questions, and I am excited to share these tools with you!
